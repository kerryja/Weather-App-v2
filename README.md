# Weather App

This app was inspired by one of Free Code Camp's takehome assignments. It uses Free Code Camp's weather API to display the current weather and "feels like" temp. Geolocation is used to grab user coordinates, while using geocoding with those coordinates to display the city and state. It includes a search component that uses reverse geocoding to take the city and state and convert to coordinates. There is also a button to switch between celsius and fahrenheit.

## Future Work

This is an ongoing project - here is a list of the current work that is being developed:
* displaying week and 10-day forecasts.
* improve styling

# Tech Used
